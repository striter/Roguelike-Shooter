If you want to use post-effect like in the demo video:

1) Download unity free post effects 
https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/essentials/post-processing-stack-83912
2) Add "PostProcessingBehaviour.cs" on main Camera.
3) Set the "Post-effects" profile. ("\Assets\ErbGameArt\Demo scene\CC.asset")
4) You should turn on "HDR" on main camera for correct post-effects. (bloom post-effect works correctly only with HDR)
If you have forward rendering path (by default in Unity), you need disable antialiasing "edit->project settings->quality->antialiasing"
or turn of "MSAA" on main camera, because HDR does not works with msaa. If you want to use HDR and MSAA then use "MSAA of post effect". 
It's faster then default MSAA and have the same quality.
